## Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

# 0 Abstract

An IPVM "job" is a declarative description of WebAssembly and managed effects to be run by the IPVM runtime.

# 1 Motivation

IPVM provides a deterministic-by-default, content addressed execution environment. Execution may always be run locally, but there are many cases where remote exection is desirable: access to large data, faster processors, trusted execution environments, or access to specialized hardware, among others.

## 1.1 Minimizing Complexity

> Every application has an inherent amount of irreducible complexity. The only question is: Who will have to deal with it â€” the user, the application developer, or the platform developer?
> -- [Tesler's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_conservation_of_complexity)

With "jobs" as the unit of execution, programmers gain flexible cache granularity, parallelism, and ___.

Configuration DSLs like IPVM jobs can become very complex. By their nature, jobs specs are responsible for describing as many 

By having to account for a huge number of possible cases, the burden is placed on the programmer in exchange for a high degree of control. Sensible defaults, [convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration), and scoped settingshelp aleviate this problem.

Partial failure in a deterministic system is simplified by using transactional semantics for the job as a whole. The difficult case lies with any effects that update the real world nonmonotonically.


### 1.1.1 Nonmonotonic Effects


# 2 Anatomy

## 2.1 Job

An IPVM job MUST be composed of the following parts:

* 

## 2.2 

# 2 Dataflow Graph

* Automatic (and deterministic) parallelism
* Dataflow / job graph
* Effects System
* Partial Failure & Transactionality 
* Auth: SPKI & object capabilities

* Wasm execution in depth
* Spec format IPLD
  * Input addressing

## 2.2 Implicit Parallelism

IPVM does not allow programmer control over parallelism. The resources available to the scheulder MAY be very different from run to run.

The concurrency plan MUST be derived from the dataflow dependencies.


# 3 Higher Abstractions

At the lowest level, IPVM jobs only describe the loading of immutible data.
