## Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119).

# 0 Abstract

An IPVM "job" is a declarative description of WebAssembly and managed effects to be run by the IPVM runtime.

# 1 Motivation

IPVM provides a deterministic-by-default, content addressed execution environment. Execution may always be run locally, but there are many cases where remote exection is desirable: access to large data, faster processors, trusted execution environments, or access to specialized hardware, among others.

## 1.1 Minimizing Complexity

> Every application has an inherent amount of irreducible complexity. The only question is: Who will have to deal with it â€” the user, the application developer, or the platform developer?
> -- [Tesler's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_conservation_of_complexity)

With "jobs" as the unit of execution, programmers gain flexible cache granularity, parallelism, and ___. Partial failure is Transactionality 

* [Convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration).
